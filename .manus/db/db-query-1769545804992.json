It highlights upcoming Medicaid cuts, changes to eligibility requirements, a temporary 2026 physician fee schedule adjustment, and renewed funding mechanisms for rural hospitals, all of which shift safety-net pressures onto clinical practices. It also outlines major personal tax modifications, including permanent bracket changes, expanded mortgage and estate tax rules, updated AMT thresholds, and changes to 529 plans. The graphic further details student loan restructuring through the phase-out of SAVE, PAYE, and ICR, increases in borrowing caps, and new consolidation requirements, together with business-oriented provisions such as continuation of the QBI deduction and restoration of 100% bonus depreciation.
